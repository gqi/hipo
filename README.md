# hipo

hipo is an R package that performs heritability informed power optimization (HIPO)<sup>1</sup> for conducting multi-trait association analysis on summary level data.

### Installing the package.

Before using this package, you need to install the LDSC software that performs LD score regression<sup>2,3</sup> to estimate heritability and genetic correlation. Click [here](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc) for LDSC. You must have Python and all the Python packages required by LDSC. LDSC recommends installing [Anaconda 2](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) which comes with all the required Python packages.

You can use the LD score files and HapMap 3 SNP list provided by LD Hub. Download and unzip by running the following code in Terminal
```bash
wget https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/eur_w_ld_chr.tar.bz2
wget https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/w_hm3.snplist.bz2
bunzip2 eur_w_ld_chr.tar.bz2
tar -xvf eur_w_ld_chr.tar
bunzip2 w_hm3.snplist.bz2
```
and put them in the `ldsc` folder. You can also specify your own LD score file later in the function.

The `dplyr` packages is also required. Type `install.packages("dplyr")` in the R console to install.

### Example 

Once you have installed and loaded the package, here's an example to guide you through the procedure.

1. Download and unzip the [Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (2013)](http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/public/lipids2013/) summary results from joint analysis of metabochip and GWAS data. Click on the link below to download.
+ [LDL](http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/public/lipids2013/jointGwasMc_LDL.txt.gz) 
+ [HDL](http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/public/lipids2013/jointGwasMc_HDL.txt.gz)
+ [Triglycerides](http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/public/lipids2013/jointGwasMc_TG.txt.gz)
+ [Total cholesterol](http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/public/lipids2013/jointGwasMc_TC.txt.gz) 

2. Read the data (I store the summary level data in the folder `blood_lipid_data`). To run the script below, install `readr` package first by typing `install.packages("readr")` in the R console.
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
traitvec = c('LDL', 'HDL', 'TG', 'TC') # Following the order on the consortium website
sumstats = list()
for (trait in traitvec){
    sumstats[[trait]] = read_delim(paste0('blood_lipid_data/jointGwasMc_', trait, '.txt'), delim = '\t') %>% filter(rsid!='.') # Remove SNPs without an rs number.
}
```

3. Preprocess the data and transform them into data frames with 9 columns:
+ rsid: RS number of SNPs.
+ A1: effect allele.
+ A2: reference allele.
+ N: sample size.
+ z: z-statistic.
+ pval: p-value.
+ chr: chromosome.
+ bp: physical position.
+ freqA1: allele frequency of A1.
```{r}
for (trait in traitvec){
    sumstats[[trait]] = sumstats[[trait]] %>%
        mutate(position = strsplit(SNP_hg19, split = ':')) %>%
        mutate(chr = as.integer(gsub('chr', '',sapply(position, function(x) x[1]))), bp = as.integer(sapply(position, function(x) x[2]))) %>%
        mutate(z = beta/se, pval = 2*(1-pnorm(abs(z))) , A1 = toupper(A1), A2 = toupper(A2)) %>%
        select(rsid, A1, A2, N, z, pval, chr, bp, freqA1 = Freq.A1.1000G.EUR) %>%
    print(trait)
}
```

4. Implement HIPO
Change the directory arguments before running the code below:
+ `out.path`: the directory where you want the intermediate LDSC output files to be stored.
+ `ldsc.path`: the directory that stores the LDSC package. We will be calling LDSC from there.
+ `python.path`: the directory of the Python version you want to use. On a Mac computer, check `~/.bash_profile` file for the path to Anaconda 2. `{python.path} can be unspecified. But in this case, your default version of Python must have all the required packages.

```{r}
library(hipo)
res = hipo(sumstats, out.path = "PATH_TO_STORE_LDSC_OUTPUT_FILES", maf.thr = 0.05, HIPOD.num = 4, ldsc.path = "PATH_TO_LDSC", python.path = "PATH_TO_PYTHON", mergeallele = TRUE, truncate = NULL)
```

Note: Error `KeyError: '[-1 -1 -1 ... -1 -2 -1] not in index'` is usually caused by a new version of `pandas`. Try reverting `pandas` to version 0.18.1.
